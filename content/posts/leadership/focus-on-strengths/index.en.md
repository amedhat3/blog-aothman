When I became a manager, I thought my job was to help my team fix their weaknesses. I was wrong—and it nearly drained the life out of my team. In my first year, I sat with each person and picked apart the areas where they struggled, thinking it would help them grow. Instead, I watched morale sink, stress rise, and productivity stall.

It wasn’t until I flipped my approach—focusing on amplifying strengths instead of repairing weaknesses—that everything changed. My team became more engaged, more confident, and more successful than I’d imagined possible. In this story, I share the exact shift I made, the mistakes I wish I’d avoided, and why this one mindset change can completely transform the way you lead.

## Problem: The Turning Point

When I first stepped into a leadership role, I believed that the fastest path to improvement was to help my team “fix” their weaknesses. During my first performance review cycle, I sat down with each person and zeroed in on their development areas—how they could get better at the things they struggled with.

It didn’t go as planned.

Instead of feeling inspired, my team became stressed, anxious, and demoralized. Productivity dipped. The atmosphere in the office shifted from motivated to tense. I realized my good intentions were actually undermining the team’s confidence and momentum.

## Actions taken: The Shift in Approach

I decided to turn the process on its head. Instead of dwelling on weaknesses, I started highlighting each person’s strengths—and finding ways to make those strengths central to their work.

If someone excelled at communication but wasn’t as technically advanced, I assigned them projects where their ability to connect with stakeholders was critical. The result? Engagement soared. Team members began taking ownership of their work because it aligned with what they naturally did best.

I also invested time in understanding what truly motivated each individual beyond the intrinsic motivations. For some, it was financial rewards. For others, it was recognition, growth opportunities, or the freedom to lead a project. I treated motivation like a personal blueprint for each team member—and acted on it.

Lastly, I made a commitment to be a partner in their growth, not just a manager. I asked them what skills they wanted to develop, offered resources like training and conferences, and made it clear that I was invested in their success. The effect was immediate: people were more enthusiastic, collaborative, and prepared to tackle bigger challenges.

## Lessons for Leaders

* **Don’t take the driver’s seat in development talks**—guide, support, and listen more than you speak.  
* **Diagnose before prescribing**—get to the root of a challenge before suggesting solutions.  
* **Invite solutions, don’t dictate them**—ask your team how they would approach a problem. This builds trust and sparks creativity.

## The Bottom Line

When leaders focus on strengths instead of weaknesses, they empower their teams to perform at their best. It’s not about ignoring improvement areas—it’s about building from a foundation of confidence and capability.
